# SqlStreamStoreDemos
In this project, we wish to explore SqlStreamStore. EventStore is a type of database in which you can store events. The need for such a type of database came due to the technique of event sourcing. There are databases that could store events, such as EventStore. SqlStreamStore is a nuget library that could be used in C# based projects. This library provides a way to convert database such as SqlServer, PostgreSQL as event store.
